# direction_flipping

Code base for Direction Reversing Neurons. 

Both analysis code and model are available.

The model allows for chaning SF, TF, temporal differences, and distance between receptors

The temporal filters can take on multiple forms (square, exponenetial, etc.)

The code can be found in the folder "model_code". The script needed in there is direction_flipping_plots.py
